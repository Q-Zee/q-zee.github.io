# Welcome
Welcome to the QuzziCode blog. My name is [Mario Guzzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seek2fly/) and I have launched this blog and associated GitHub repository to share knowledge about Quantum Annealing, what it is, what I find it useful for and mostly to help those interested in implementing solutions to real-world problems using Quantum Computing today. 

# Quantum Annealing for everyone
One of the purpose of the blog is to introduce, with examples, the concept of Quantum Annealing, a specialized implementation of a quantum computer. Another is to open some source code to contributors who wish to advance existing and upcoming code.

There can be a lot to unpack to get started with Quantum Annealing. I will be sharing a few tutorials, code and videos demonstrating what I have learned and will listen to feedback as to what people are interested in learning.
